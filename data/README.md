# Data Directory

This directory contains the following subdirectories:

- `models/`: Directory for storing model files
- `temp/`: Temporary files generated during processing
- `output/`: Processed output files

## Usage

- Place your model files in the `models` directory
- The application will use the `temp` directory for temporary storage during processing
- Processed results will be saved in the `output` directory

## Note

- The contents of the `temp` directory can be safely deleted when the application is not running
- The `output` directory should be backed up regularly to prevent data loss
